"""
DeepLabV2 implementation with ResNet-101 backbone.

- The ResNet-101 backbone is modified to use atrous (dilated) convolutions in conv4_x and conv5_x
  to preserve spatial resolution while increasing the receptive field.
- ASPP (Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling) applies parallel convolutions with different dilation rates
  to capture multi-scale context without downsampling.
- A final 1x1 convolution acts as the classifier, followed by bilinear upsampling to restore
  the output to the original image resolution.
- Weights are initialized as in the original DeepLab paper.
